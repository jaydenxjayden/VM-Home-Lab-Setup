<h1>This is an old computer of mine which I have decided to repurpose for my future projects.</h1>

1. Firstly, I checked its specifications and found out that its the Asus model m80cj desktop.

2. After backing up the files within the system, I installed a fresh Windows 10 OS using the [Windows Bootable USB Drive](https://github.com/projecturl) I created previously.

3. I inserted the USB Drive, navigated to settings > recovery options and selected 'Restart now' under advanced startup.

4. Select 'Use a device' option, and proceed to UEFI during rebooting to select the USB Drive

5. Since all important files are backed up, I can delete all partitions on current drive.

   P.S.
   Since I only have one Ethernet port available, I've acquired a network switch to enable an internet connection via Ethernet for both my primary computer and the newly set up Windows machine.
   I purchased the TP-LINK LS1005G Gigabit Network Switch from Lazada. It can allow for up to 5 ports, which would be sufficient for my home lab.
