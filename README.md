<h1>My Virtual Playground: Home Lab Setup Using Virtual Machines</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
I started my learning journey in Cybersecurity on Sep 23, mainly using learning platforms such as TryHackMe and HackTheBox. I have only used the machines provided by these websites and I felt that it was very limited. That is what got me thinking about building my own Homelab for myself so that I can not only have hands-on practice on configuring the machines, but also have a safe environment for me to poke around in. I decided that creating a Homelab using Virtual Machines (VM) would be the most cost-efficient for my current learning goals. This is my write-up of creating my Homelab using VM.

7. As for the server environment, I have decided that it will run on Ubuntu, as it is widely used and is known for its stability. (I had no idea setting up the server environment is much more complicated ðŸ˜¥)
